## Origin

G0rKing was created as the Capstone Project delivery for the completion of the COHORT-3 course and certification. COHORT-3 was offered through the joint initiative of C3i Center (IIT, Kanpur) and Talentsprint in the year 2021. The course title is "Advanced Certification Program in Cyber Security and Cyber Defense"

## Capabilities

The objective of G0rKing is to automate the Google Dorking process and offers a way to save the end results in a text file for easy reference and reporting purposes. It can also automate the process of checking one URL against multiple dorks and can hence provide a quick health check.

## Future Roadmap

To create a vulnerability scoring system based on the findings.
