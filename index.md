G0rKing was created as the Capstone Project delivery for the completion of the COHORT-3 course and certification. COHORT-3 was offered through the joint initiative of C3i Center (IIT, Kanpur) and Talentsprint in the year 2021. The course title is "Advanced Certification Program in Cyber Security and Cyber Defense"

The objective of G0rKing is to automate the Google Dorking process and offers a way to save the end results in a text file for easy reference and reporting purposes. It can also automate the process of checking one URL against multiple dorks and can hence provide a quick health check.
